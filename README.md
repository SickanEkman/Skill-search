# Skill Matcher

Skill Matcher finds specific words in a text and outputs them and their start and end position in the text.

Project is made for a recruitment process. The program only makes sense when two specific files are used as input (although I guess it *can* be used with any files where "skills.txt" is a list with items on new line)

## Getting started

These isntructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.5 (not tested for other versions)
* Files "job-posting.txt" and "skills.txt" in same folder as code files.

### Installing

Type this command into your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/SickanEkman/xxxxxxxx
```

## Running 

### The program
```
> python3 skill_search.py
```
Then wait a few seconds :)

### The tests
```
python3 test_skill_search.py
```
